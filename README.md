# Diploma---Complex-Data-Structures
Assessments from Diploma in Information Technology at TAFE.
The first assessment loads data from a supplied .dll file based on user input, then highlights specific data based on a user input search target and displays the time taken for the search to occur. Data is split into two sets and both have all search capabilities.

The second assessment uses a .dll file that I created to perform calculations based on user input. The calculations are performed through a server application from the client application, with no link between the library and the client application. The user can also change the language of the page with a button selection or from a menu tab, and can change the colour scheme of the page in a similar way.

The third assessment is a keyboard driven program that loads data from a .csv file and allows for user interaction. The user can filter the data down for a specific entry, then use keyboard inputs to open a secondary window that allows for the entry of new data, or the edit or deletion of existing data.
